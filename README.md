# Used Car Machine Learning Algorithm

Developed and trained a machine learning model to predict the prices of cars based on given parameters, such as horsepower, 0-60 MPH times, and the manufactured year of the car.
Pulled dataset from Kaggle, utilized NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SK Learn.
Developed in VS-Code, "deployed" using JupyterLabs and Google Colab.

# Concluded that the dataset was not properly parsed and cleaned, and the machine learning algorithm is hilariously inaccurate as a result.
